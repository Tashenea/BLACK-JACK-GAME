Reflection #3

It I took me a long while to complete this because I was trying to learn the material and I did not ask for help when I needed to. 
I have to learn that just do my best submit I have to get credit for the class. Instead of trying to complete the assignment
right the first time. Learning with unity I think is a great challenge for me because doing this was I have some serious time management issues.
If I don’t change my approach quickly I will be in the same area of falling behind. I know this is grace fall but I am losing motivation but I
just want to be able to do something that is fun that I can really show that I am fully understanding the material being taught.
I wish there was more group activities that can help me think more computer science. I am not slow in the material it is just I don’t have 
anyone to really talk to about the computer science ideas beside the teacher. I want to learn how to communicate and build friendships in the
computer science field because I know I am going to fail if I don’t find friends. Also I really need to stop being shy in the class and move 
beyond the fact that I am black in a field that is hard to attend when no one looks like me. I would talk to my mom about it all the time and 
she would tell me that it doesn’t matter do it for your younger siblings so that you can help them when their time comes.
